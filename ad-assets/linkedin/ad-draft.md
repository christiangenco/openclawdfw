## My Recommendation

**Go with Option A (your photo).** LinkedIn is a personal-trust platform. A real person at a real desk setting up real hardware will massively outperform a branded graphic. It's also the core positioning — "I show up in person, shake your hand, and make sure the thing works." The photo communicates that instantly.

The OG image is great for link previews and could work as a second ad variant later if you want to A/B test.

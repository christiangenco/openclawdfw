## What SetupClaw Does

SetupClaw (setupclaw.com) is a white-glove consultancy that deploys and maintains [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) — an open-source AI executive assistant that manages email, calendar, and workflows — for founders and exec teams at companies with 4–50+ employees. The SF Bay Area business (run by Michael Chomsky) offers:

- **In-person implementation** ($2,400) or **remote** ($1,200): install, harden, integrate email/calendar/messaging, build up to 3 workflows, and 14-day hypercare via Slack Connect.
- **Additional Executive Agents** ($1,200 each): one OpenClaw instance per identity (CEO, CFO, Head of Sales, shared EA inbox, etc.).
- **Managed Care plans** ($1,875–$7,500+/mo): ongoing monitoring, updates, drift checks, support hours, and security reviews.
- Security-first positioning: runs on customer hardware, follows the official OpenClaw hardening guide, passes InfoSec/CISO review.
- Expanding to new cities via **licensed operators**.

## Dallas / DFW Experiment

Goal: become the Dallas/Fort Worth licensed operator (or independent consultancy) doing the same thing — white-glove OpenClaw deployment and managed care for DFW-based founders, exec teams, and SMBs. In-person setup in the Metroplex, remote available everywhere.

## Executive Summary

The biggest takeaway: **"OpenClaw" and DFW-specific queries have essentially zero search volume.** Nobody is googling for this yet. That's actually good news — it means:

1. You're not competing with established players for brand terms
2. Your Google Ads strategy should target **generic high-intent AI assistant queries** and geo-fence them to DFW
3. Content should target the **problems people know they have** (email overload, scheduling chaos) rather than solutions they don't know exist yet

## 1. Google Ads Recommendations

### Tier 1: Start Here (High intent × High value × Reasonable competition)

| Keyword | Volume | CPC | Difficulty | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **ai executive assistant** | 1,000 | $15.95 | 5 | Your exact service. Difficulty 5 is absurdly low. |
| **ai email assistant** | 2,400 | $12.26 | 35 | Huge volume, directly maps to your demo |
| **ai scheduling assistant** | 1,600 | $17.57 | 30 | High volume, clear pain point |
| **ai secretary** | 720 | $13.89 | 23 | Old-school term = old-school buyer (your customer) |
| **ai chief of staff** | 170 | $7.46 | 0 | Zero competition, very high-intent, exactly your buyer |

**Recommended starting budget:** $50–100/day geo-fenced to DFW. These keywords are national volume; DFW will be a fraction of that, so your actual spend will be much lower. Start with exact match on these 5 keywords and see what converts.

### Tier 2: Industry Verticals (Expensive but laser-targeted)

| Keyword | Volume | CPC | Difficulty | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **ai for law firms** | 1,300 | $33.50 | 41 | Your #1 target vertical. $33 CPC is high but the LTV of a law firm client at $2k+/mo is enormous |
| **ai for personal injury lawyers** | 70 | $103.33 | 13 | Insane CPC = insane buyer intent. Only 70 searches/month but these people are ready to spend |
| **law firm automation** | 70 | $81.67 | 0 | Same — low volume, huge intent, zero difficulty |
| **ai for real estate agents** | 480 | $12.24 | 42 | Good volume, reasonable CPC |
| **insurance agency automation** | 40 | $53.34 | 13 | Low volume but very high intent |

**Note:** The $100+ CPC on "ai for personal injury lawyers" is a signal that these lawyers are already spending heavily on digital marketing. They understand paid leads. They're your ideal customer.

### Tier 3: Pain-Point Keywords (Great for ad copy, moderate volume)

| Keyword | Volume | CPC | Difficulty |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ai inbox management** | 110 | $18.32 | 44 |
| **ai email sorting** | 110 | $33.93 | 20 |
| **ai email triage** | 50 | $4.66 | 17 |
| **too many emails** | 210 | $3.31 | 0 |
| **inbox zero ai** | 30 | $5.48 | 0 |

These are great for ad copy angles even if you don't bid on them directly. "Drowning in email?" speaks directly to the 210 people/month googling "too many emails."

### DFW Geo Keywords: All Zero Volume

Every single DFW-specific query ("ai consultant dallas," "ai automation dallas," etc.) returned **zero volume**. This means:

- Don't waste money bidding on geo-specific keywords
- Instead, bid on **national keywords** (like "ai executive assistant") and **geo-fence the ads to DFW**
- Your local advantage is in the sales call and in-person setup, not in search terms

## 2. Content / Blog Post Recommendations

### Best Opportunities (decent volume, low difficulty = can rank organically)

| Keyword | Volume | Diff | Post Idea |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ai workflow automation** | 880 | 25 | "How AI Workflow Automation Actually Works (With Real Examples)" — pillar content piece |
| **how to use ai at work** | 320 | 17 | "How to Use AI at Work: A Practical Guide for Business Owners" — beginner guide |
| **open source ai assistant** | 140 | 49 | "Open Source AI Assistants: Why OpenClaw Is Different" — comparison/positioning |
| **ai hipaa compliance** | 140 | 30 | "AI and HIPAA Compliance: What Business Owners Need to Know" — trust builder, great for medical/legal |
| **self hosted ai assistant** | 50 | 48 | "Why Self-Hosted AI Beats Cloud AI for Security" — plays directly to your moat |

### Content Themes That Map to the Funnel

**Top of funnel** (awareness, high volume):
- "AI Email Assistant: What It Is and How It Works" (2,400 vol)
- "What Is an AI Executive Assistant?" (0 vol but important for brand)
- "AI for Law Firms: The Complete Guide" (1,300 vol)

**Middle of funnel** (consideration):
- "AI Assistant vs. Virtual Assistant: Which Should You Hire?" (0 vol as exact match, but the concept is hot)
- "Is It Safe to Give AI Access to Your Email?" (0 vol but every prospect thinks this)
- "AI Readiness Assessment: Is Your Business Ready?" (480 vol!)

**Bottom of funnel** (decision):
- "How We Set Up an AI Executive Assistant for a Dallas Law Firm" (case study)
- "What to Expect When You Deploy OpenClaw" (product content)

### Security Content = Your Moat

The security/objection keywords all have zero search volume, BUT these are the exact questions every prospect will ask on the sales call. Write them as blog posts anyway:

- "Is It Safe to Give AI Access to Your Email?"
- "On-Premise AI vs. Cloud AI: A Security Comparison"
- "AI Data Privacy for Business Owners"

These won't drive search traffic but they're perfect for:
1. Sending to prospects before/after the sales call
2. Building trust and authority
3. SEO long-tail over time as the market matures

## 3. Lead Magnet Recommendations

### What the Data Says

| Keyword | Volume | Diff | CPC |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ai readiness assessment** | 480 | 10 | $33.63 |
| **best ai tools 2025** | 480 | 37 | $9.07 |
| **ai roi calculator** | 70 | 0 | $14.41 |
| **ai for ceo** | 50 | 7 | $22.73 |

### Recommended Lead Magnet: "AI Readiness Assessment"

**Why:** 480 monthly searches, difficulty of 10 (trivially easy to rank for), and a $33.63 CPC means people are paying a LOT for this traffic. An interactive assessment or PDF checklist gated behind email capture would:

1. Rank organically for "ai readiness assessment" (difficulty 10!)
2. Qualify leads automatically (the assessment tells you how ready they are)
3. Give you an email + context for follow-up ("Based on your answers, you're a great fit for...")
4. Work as a Google Ads landing page too

**Format:** Interactive quiz on the website (5-8 questions) → results emailed → CTA to book AI Opportunity Audit.

Questions like:
- How many emails do you get per day?
- Do you have a virtual assistant or EA currently?
- What industry are you in?
- How many employees?
- What's your biggest time sink?

### Runner-Up Lead Magnets

1. **"AI ROI Calculator"** — 70 vol, 0 difficulty, $14 CPC. Interactive calculator: "Enter your hours spent on email/scheduling → see what AI saves you." Very bottom-of-funnel.
2. **"The AI Employee Playbook"** — No single keyword matches but covers "ai use cases for small business," "tasks to automate with ai," "things ai can do for business" as a cluster.

## 4. Key Insights

### OpenClaw is pre-market
95 of 154 keywords (62%) returned zero volume. "OpenClaw" itself has only 10 searches/month nationally. The market hasn't formed yet around this product name. You're building demand, not capturing it.

### The "AI Employee" metaphor resonates in search
"AI employee" (2,400/mo) and "ai worker" (2,400/mo) both have massive volume. Your "staffing agency for AI" positioning maps perfectly to how people are already searching. Use this language in ads and content.

### Law firms are the money vertical
"AI for law firms" = 1,300 vol, $33.50 CPC. "AI for personal injury lawyers" = $103 CPC (!). "Law firm automation" = $81 CPC. These lawyers are already spending aggressively on digital marketing. They understand the value of leads. Target them first.

### Your security positioning has no search demand yet — but it will
Every security/privacy keyword returned zero. But this is exactly the objection that kills deals. Write the content now, rank for it early, and you'll own these terms when the market catches up.

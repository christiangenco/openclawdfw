        - text: ", here's how it works: 4 agents, each with their own job: - main one: strategy, planning, big picture. coordinates the others - dev agent: coding, technical problems, architecture decisions - marketing agent: research, content ideas, competitor analysis - business agent: pricing, metrics, growth strategy what makes it actually useful: - shared memory for the big stuff (project docs, goals, key decisions) - but each agent also has their own context (past messages) - different models for different jobs (codex for coding, Gemini for marketing etc) - scheduled daily tasks without me asking (content prompts, reddit monitoring, reminders) - agents can work in parallel - connected to my notes so nothing gets lost It all runs on my VPS and I control them all through Telegram, so it basically works as a real small team available 24/7. I even gave them names and different characters: - Milo (leader - confident and charismatic), - Josh (business guy - pragmatic and straight to the point, numbers-driven), - Angela (marketing - extroverted, funny and full of ideas), - Bob (coding - introverted analytical genius). I’m still setting up all the skills, but so far it really works great and it’s a first use case that’s so beneficial to me and can help me in my daily work. Thank you"

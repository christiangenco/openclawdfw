      - 'article "steve caldwell 🎉 Verified account @stevecaldwell Update on Crawdad 🦞 (my AI Assistant running on @openclaw by @steipete ) Tonight we built a full weekly meal planning system in Notion. My wife and I take turns cooking, so we had Crawdad set up: - Master meal plan template for all of 2026 (365 days) - Shopping lists sorted by store and aisle (Kroger/Costco/Lowes) - Weather forecast auto-updating on the meal plan list (helps me plan good nights for grilling, soup, etc) - Our go-to recipes catalogued by chef - ⁠It''ll remind me in morning/evening digests if I need to plan dinner or grab groceries. I imagine that this will save us at least an hour a week. github.com/steipete/clawd Image 13 replies, 8 reposts, 148 likes, 165 bookmarks, 20018 views"':

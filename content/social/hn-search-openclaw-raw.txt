      - text: Hi HN, I built the cheapest managed
      - emphasis: OpenClaw
      - text: hosting I could - $0.99/mo for your own instance. I tried hosting it myself first - went through GCP (e2-micro and e2-small both too little RAM, e2-medium was ~$25/mo), Hostinger ($5.99 is a 12-month lock-in), Hetzner (auto ID verification failed twice). Finally got it running on OVH and noticed it was idle 90% of the time. So I containerized the setup and started sharing it with friends.
      - paragraph: "What each person gets: their own isolated instance with full UI, terminal access, SSL. Setup takes about 30 seconds. $0.99/mo."
        - text: "How it works: Containerized shared infrastructure with per-tenant isolation. Each instance runs in its own container with dedicated resources and burst capacity. SSL is automated via Let's Encrypt. The economics work because"
        - emphasis: OpenClaw
        - text: usage is bursty - nobody's hammering it 24/7, so density is high.
        - text: "The question I'm testing: how cheap can managed hosting for open-source tools actually get? The marginal cost of a small container is cents. Most of the cost in managed hosting is support, marketing, and margin, not compute. I wanted to offer the most affordable way to try"

      - text: People seem to be blindly hooking up their
      - emphasis: OpenClaw
      - text: ’s to their personal data. So, I built runtime controls to prevent at the least, very simple prompt injection attacks.
      - paragraph: Once installed, it hooks to Node.js child_process module in the gateway process and listens to tool calls and their response streams. And a fetch hook to monitor user prompts (both could’ve been through fetch, happy to discuss why this whole layer couldn’t just be a proxy).
      - paragraph: "There are two layers of protection:"
      - paragraph: "First: Whenever there is a read-only tool call whose response an attacker can modify, we extract that part of the json response and send it to a small haiku model to check if it has instruction asking the LLM to do something different"
      - paragraph: "Second: For when the prompt injection detection fails, we maintain a list of function calls which can write to places that an external actor can access. We prompt the user for explicit permission to go forward through the UI."
      - paragraph: "I would love a discussion on how this second layer could be made better and less frequent by relying on some decision process. My current idea: Based on a collected set of “trusted” context (user prompts, responses from tool calls attackers cannot manipulate), can we detect if this tool call was necessary. There are scenarios where you’d need detection at the parameter-level."
      - paragraph: "Two notes:"
      - paragraph: 1) This cannot just be a proxy because you need application level integration to have humans in the loop when needed and push UI controls.
      - paragraph: 2) How i improved accuracy of detecting prompt injection is by selecting only that content from the entire response json that can be manipulated by an external actor. This had to be done for each tool separately. The current implementation is for 2 skills I randomly chose (Notion & Github).

      - text: is seemingly just another way to chat with an AI on another non-AI centric platform instead of the CLI or the company's site. Then, you have to give it so many API keys to actually utilise it, which for me has shattered the image of it enabling complete autonomy. Yes, I get that it's just an one-time thing, but all these platforms have AIs of their own at this point, why would I go through this new hassle. That too some have expiring API keys or certain limits as well. All in all, AGAIN, a feature, not a product.

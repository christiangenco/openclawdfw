        - text: This is my new favorite way to work with Clawdbot. 1. Tell it we're working on some app improvements, it should just take notes for now. 2. Open my app, run through user flows, send Clawd screenshots with notes as I find issues / improvements 3. It builds a list of work as we go, adds its own notes and hypotheses 4. When I'm done, it writes up a full report on what to do that I review. 5. I say "Go" and it kicks off Codex agents to attack the different pieces, opening separate PRs and reporting back on their status 6. Claude reviews & improves the PRs on Github 7. Clawd makes a doc of everything we did + what to test 8. Next time I test, I start with that list to make sure everything worked, pass in notes which it can cross-reference with its own notes on what it did before to build better fixes if anything didn't work.

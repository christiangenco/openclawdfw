We all know that AI is transformative but I don't think you really feel it until you step outside the prompt/response loop and step into the prompt/take real actions on my behalf/response loop. - I got BigC to check on the deployment of a new railway project - Builds for each of the services in the project failed - BigC reviewed the logs - Then reviewed the project on the server - Identified the root cause (incorrect build commands on each service) - Updated the configs of each in railway - Redeployed - Confirmed everything worked - I then tested it - Identified a design issue - Got BigC to review, fix and submit a PR - job done oh and all this was done over voice when walking the fucking dog...

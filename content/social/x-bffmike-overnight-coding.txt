      - article "Mike Manzano ✨ ᯅ Verified account @bffmike My @openclaw drove my coding agents after i went to bed last night from 12:30–7ish am while i snoozed. MUCH better than a Ralph loop because you don’t just give it a prompt about when to stop looping. Instead I’ve been delegating management of coding agents to it ALL DAY. It knows about the entire project history, all the headaches. it drives better than Ralph because it’s been watching me all day. This continues to amaze @steipete ! maybe something to try @ryancarson ! Image 1 repost, 6 likes, 5 bookmarks, 636 views" [ref=e12]:

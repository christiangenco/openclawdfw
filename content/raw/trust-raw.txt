      - heading "Trust" [ref=e8] [level=1]
      - paragraph: Security posture, roadmap, and how we think about agents that can take real-world actions.
      - heading "A New Era in Computing Security" [ref=e9] [level=2]
      - paragraph: For the past 20 years, security models have been built around locking devices and applications down - setting boundaries between inter-process communications, separating internet from local, sandboxing untrusted code. These principles remain important.
      - paragraph: But AI agents represent a fundamental shift.
      - paragraph: Unlike traditional software that does exactly what code tells it to do, AI agents interpret natural language and make decisions about actions. They blur the boundary between user intent and machine execution. They can be manipulated through language itself.
      - paragraph: We understand that with the great utility of a tool like OpenClaw comes great responsibility. Done wrong, an AI agent is a liability. Done right, we can change personal computing for the better.
        - strong: This security program exists to get it right.
      - heading "Context" [ref=e10] [level=2]
      - paragraph: "OpenClaw is an AI agent platform. Unlike chatbots that only generate text, OpenClaw agents can:"
        - listitem: Execute shell commands on the host machine
        - listitem: Send messages through WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, and other channels
        - listitem: Read and write files in the workspace
        - listitem: Fetch arbitrary URLs from the internet
        - listitem: Schedule automated tasks
        - listitem: Access connected services and APIs
      - paragraph: This capability is what makes OpenClaw useful. It's also what makes security critical.
      - paragraph: "AI agents that can take real-world actions introduce risks that traditional software doesn't have:"
          - strong: Prompt injection
          - text: "- Malicious users can craft messages that manipulate the AI into performing unintended actions"
          - strong: Indirect injection
          - text: "- Malicious content in fetched URLs, emails, or documents can hijack agent behavior"
          - strong: Tool abuse
          - text: "- Even without injection, misconfigured agents can cause damage through overly permissive settings"
          - strong: Identity risks
          - text: "- Agents can send messages as you, potentially damaging relationships or reputation"
      - paragraph: These aren't theoretical. They're documented attack patterns that affect all AI agent systems.

      - text: "\"Why develop the threat model openly?\""
      - paragraph: These attack techniques are already public knowledge - documented in papers, blogs, and talks. Developing openly benefits from collective expertise, builds trust through transparency, and holds us accountable.
      - text: "\"Why require remediation advice in vulnerability reports?\""
      - paragraph: We receive reports from automated scanners and AI tools that flag theoretical issues without understanding them. By requiring reporters to propose a fix, we filter out scanner noise, get actionable reports from researchers who understand the issues, and speed up remediation with expert input.
      - text: "\"What about ClawHub?\""

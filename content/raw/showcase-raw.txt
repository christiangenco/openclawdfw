I even gave them names and different characters: - Milo (leader - confident and charismatic), - Josh (business guy - pragmatic and straight to the point, numbers-driven), - Angela (marketing - extroverted, funny and full of ideas), - Bob (coding - introverted analytical genius). I'm still setting up all the skills, but so far it really works great and it's a first use case that's so beneficial to me and can help me in my daily work."

Some Skills in action: - Kyutai Pocket TTS - Whisper audio transcribe - Browser use (web scraping, form filling) - Twitter ops I hacked this up in <5 days, all on my mobile while I was on the move."

      - paragraph: "My new favorite way to work with OpenClaw: 1. Tell it we're working on app improvements, it should just take notes 2. Run through user flows, send screenshots with notes as I find issues 3. It builds a list of work, adds its own hypotheses 4. Writes up a full report on what to do 5. I say \"Go\" and it kicks off Codex agents to attack the different pieces, opening separate PRs 6. Claude reviews & improves the PRs on Github 7. Claw makes a doc of everything we did + what to test 8. Next time I test, I start with that list to make sure everything worked"

## X Posts (for @cgenco)

### Post 1 — The Hook (publish immediately)

```
I just published the most comprehensive guide to AI executive assistants I've seen anywhere.

What they actually do (not hype). How they're different from ChatGPT. Real examples. Security. Honest comparison with human VAs.

If you run a business and spend >1 hour/day in your inbox, read this:

```

### Post 2 — The "Holy Shit" Moment (publish 2-3 hours later)

```
Someone's AI assistant found their upcoming flight in email, ran through check-in, and picked a window seat.

While they were driving.

This is what an AI executive assistant actually looks like in 2026. Not a chatbot. An employee.

I wrote up everything I know about how they work:

### Post 3 — The Pain Point (publish tomorrow morning)

```
Business owners I talk to spend 2-3 hours a day just managing their inbox.

That's 15 hours a week. 60 hours a month. 720 hours a year.

An AI executive assistant does that in seconds. 24/7. No sick days.

The catch: most people set them up wrong (and the security risks are real if you do).

Here's how to do it right:

### Post 4 — The Law Firm Angle (publish tomorrow afternoon)

```
If you're a managing partner at a law firm and you're not looking at AI executive assistants, you're leaving money on the table.

- Email triage (flag client emails, archive noise)
- Meeting prep (pull case files, last correspondence, notes)
- Follow-up drafts after every call
- Scheduling across multiple calendars

All running 24/7 on hardware in your office.

I'm placing AI employees for law firms in DFW. Free 30-min audit:

### Post 5 — The Thread Starter (publish Wednesday)

```
I did keyword research on what business owners are googling about AI assistants.

Some surprising findings 🧵

1/ "AI executive assistant" — 1,000 searches/month. The demand is real and growing fast.

2/ "AI for personal injury lawyers" — only 70 searches/month but the CPC is $103. Lawyers are already spending heavily to find this.

3/ Every single "AI consultant Dallas" type keyword? Zero volume. Nobody is searching for local AI help yet. First mover advantage is massive.

4/ "AI employee" — 2,400 searches/month. People are already thinking of AI as a team member, not a tool.

5/ The biggest signal: "ai readiness assessment" — 480/month. Business owners want to know if they're READY for AI. Not whether AI works. We're past that.

I'm building an AI staffing consultancy in DFW. This research is shaping everything.

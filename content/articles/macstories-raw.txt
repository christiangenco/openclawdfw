Five minutes of back and forth later, Clawd created everything on my Mac, with no cloud dependency, no subscription required – just the task I asked for, pieced together by an LLM with existing shell tools and Internet access. It makes me wonder how many automation layers and services I could replace by giving Clawd some prompts and shell access.

I especially worry about standalone utility apps: if OpenClaw can create a virtual remote for my LG television (something I did) or give me a personalized report with voice every morning (another"

Not the “set a timer” version of worked, but genuinely understood your life, remembered your preferences, and could actually do things on your computer while you’re away? That’s the promise that has developers on X losing their minds over a project called Clawdbot, and it’s triggering a run on Apple’s smallest computer.
      - paragraph: "The creator, Peter Steinberger, puts it bluntly: “Apps will melt away. The prompt is your new interface.” Steinberger isn’t some random tinkerer. He’s the former CEO of PSPDFKit, who built that company over 13 years before selling it. Now he’s come out of retirement to help a cartoon lobster take over the world of personal computing."

        - text: is an open-source AI agent that runs on your own hardware. Unlike ChatGPT or Claude’s web interfaces, which process everything on remote servers, Clawdbot operates locally with a “gateway” that connects AI models to the apps and services you already use. It can talk to you through WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, or even iMessage.
      - paragraph:
        - text: But the real magic is what it can do once it’s running. Given the right permissions, Clawdbot can browse the web, execute terminal commands, write and run scripts, manage your email, check your calendar, and interact with any software on your machine. Federico Viticci of MacStories

      - paragraph: Perhaps the most compelling feature is that Clawdbot is self-improving. Tell it you want a new capability, and it can often write its own “skill” (plugin) to make it happen. One user wanted access to university course assignments. He asked Clawdbot to build a skill for it. Clawdbot did, and then started using it on its own.

      - paragraph: The lobster branding, by the way, isn’t random. When Steinberger was developing the project with Claude, the AI suggested naming its persona “Clawdis” as a joke about a space lobster in a TARDIS. The name evolved into Clawdbot, and the crustacean theme stuck. There’s even a “Lobster Mode” where the bot becomes intentionally opinionated and cranky.
      - heading "Why Everyone’s Buying Mac Minis" [ref=e21] [level=2]
      - paragraph: Here’s where hardware enters the picture. While Clawdbot can run on any computer, Mac Minis have emerged as the preferred choice, and for good reasons that go beyond Apple fandom.
      - paragraph: Apple Silicon’s unified memory architecture is exceptionally efficient for AI workloads. Instead of the CPU and GPU communicating over a slower connection, the memory sits directly on the chip package. This means the full memory bandwidth is instantly available to AI models, making local inference significantly faster than on traditional x86 systems with equivalent specs.

      - paragraph: Privacy is another major driver. Your agent needs to index your emails, files, and personal data to be truly useful. Many developers are uncomfortable sending all that information to cloud providers. With Clawdbot on a Mac Mini at home, your data never leaves your physical control.

      - paragraph: The use cases emerging from the Clawdbot community range from practical to absurd. Someone asked their bot to unsubscribe from unwanted emails.

The agent can kick off test suites, monitor for errors via webhooks, and even open pull requests to fix issues it finds. One user has it controlling smart home devices, adjusting air purifier settings based on health metrics from their wearable.
      - paragraph: Perhaps the most amusing story involves an agent that “accidentally started a fight” with an insurance company. The user’s Clawdbot misinterpreted a response and sent an email that caused the insurer to reinvestigate a claim that had been rejected. The agent’s assertiveness worked in the user’s favor, but it highlights both the power and the risks of autonomous AI agents.

      - paragraph: For users who want to run larger local models alongside Clawdbot, the 24GB configuration at $999 provides headroom. The M4 Pro variant at $1,399 supports up to 64GB of unified memory, which becomes relevant if you’re running quantized versions of models like Llama locally while still using cloud APIs for heavier reasoning tasks.
      - paragraph: Since Clawdbot can run on a Raspberry Pi, you don’t need a powerhouse. If you prefer Linux (which Clawdbot actually supports better than Windows), these budget x86 mini PCs get the job done for a fraction of the Mac Mini’s price. Both ship with Windows but run Linux beautifully.

      - paragraph: Steinberger has built in safeguards, and you can configure exactly what permissions your agent has. But the fundamental premise of letting an LLM execute commands on your machine requires trust in both the underlying AI models and the Clawdbot codebase. It’s open source, which helps, but most users won’t be auditing the code themselves.
      - paragraph: The security model for personal AI agents is still evolving. What happens when your agent has your credentials, can access your email, and is prompted by a carefully crafted message that looks innocent but contains adversarial instructions? These aren’t solved problems.
